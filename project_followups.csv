29,"How do I get my ""matching slots"" reporter block spit out numbers? I know it has to do with the ""join"" block, but I'm stuck"
31,"Hey, if we do Project 1 with a partner, can we submit the same code or are we supposed to have completely different codes from each other?"
189,"Can you elaborate a bit on what you mean when you say that you cannot figure out how to report numbers? Do you mean you are having difficulty writing the matching slots block, or that you want to report a numerical value but are unsure how to? If your question is the former, can you explain what you have tried so far? If it is the latter, then you can report numbers the same way you report anything else using the report block."
314,"Gotcha! Thank you! Now I stuck on another problem, even if the player figures out the word, it continues asking what's your guess. It doesn't stop. But on my repeat statement I'm checking it, so it should run until its false. But it keeps running no matter if the player guessed the word or not.

"
316,"Also, I'm not sure how to check all the letters in a word if they consist of ROYJBV. Should I use if statement for every letter in a word ? But then how to make sure if a letter is only in the range of ROYJBV. I'm kinda lost on my own thoughts."
319,"Also, if the word is longer than 4 or a letter is not in the range, what should it do? Repeat or just send the message about the wrong input."
321,"

Is that ok if I'll show the player the length and guessed word on the stage, so that way the player can see the word and the correct slots."
336,Thank you! Also should I keep the guess variable in the top left corner (it can be seen in of the screenshots)? Or should I hide it (make it invisible)?
372,"The directions for Project 1 part 2 say ""Both the secret code and the guess should be case-insensitive (i.e. rrrr = RRRR)."" The directions say that the game SHOULD be case sensitive, but the example is showing that the letters are not case sensitive (because rrrr = RRRR). Which is correct?"
374,I am having trouble finding the min block for the out of place block. Am I missing something?
376,"If the user enters an invalid guess (too many letters, not enough letters, etc.), does that still count as a ""guess""? I was wondering abut this because we have to report the number of guesses at the end of the game."
379,"Is the ""Extra for Experience"" part extra credit? If not, what is the extra credit? "
381,"I have tried creating script variables, using the if block to check if the list will contain the letter specified, and then storing them in those variables. However, I'm not sure where to go from there and how to use the HOFs in this. Can I have some advice on creating the ""occurrences of"" block?"
425,"Hey Emersyn,

Thanks for stopping by OH and for being determined about solving this problem.

I hope Maxson's explanation clarifies some questions you had. Do let us know if any other ones come up!"
429,This is great!
433,"'pick random'  is for numbers , do I need to import any library in order to use 'pick random' for letters?"
471,"Answering down here because I'm not 100% on this:
I guess you won't be penalized, but I'm not sure how you were able to make the ""out-of-place"" block without ""keep characters not in same place"" and the ""occurrences of"" blocks without repeating the same code. 

If the code on the OOP block is basically the same as the code in the other two, you may be docked for repetitive code/not abstracting properly"
530,Yes! Thank you!
531,Are there any instructors available right now to help me with the same question?
539,"Hi there, can someone send the link to the starter file again? I can't open it, my Snap! says ""Could not fetch undefined file doesn't exist""."
543,"For the 3rd block ""merge column x of list up"", I am having difficulty setting the ""x"" value to be the column it only sets ""x"" as the rows, I'm probably making a super simple mistake do I need to form a new list or use something like a HOF, maybe I'm just typing something wrong, hope what I'm asking makes sense"
545,"For the add 2 or 4 block, can I have any hint on how to make 2 to have 75% chance over 4? "

614,Hey! I don’t have a partner yet. My email is achen87@berkeley.edu.
615,"Hi!
I am also looking for a partner for project 2 too! If anyone is looking for a partner, please email me at khanhhuynh2111@berkeley.edu ! "
618,"Also, please note! If you downloaded the Snap! starter file for Project 2 between 7pm PDT yesterday, 7/12 and 3pm PDT today, 7/13, you will need to download it again as we temporarily linked to a Project 1.2 file instead of a Project 2 file."
662,"On the Syllabus, the Mastermind project is written as only having 25 points but Part 1 and Part 2 together have 30 points, if we are self-calculating a grade should we go off of the points on gradescope (basically 30 not 25), also I'm assuming that means that the Project section as a whole has 230 points not 225 as reported on the syllabus, or will the part 1 and part 2 be only counted as 25 points"
803,*Friday the 24th?
805,"I'm not sure why, but for some reason, both the spec on the website and here won't open for me."
810,"Can you clarify ""At least two of the sources must be from no earlier than January 2015.""

Does that imply two sources have to be before or after the date?"
812,"I just want to clarify this. 

""You MUST properly denote and cite any direct quotations used in your assignment. To be clear: any time you copy any lines of text from any of your sources, you must (1) place the copied text in quotation marks and (2) include the author’s name in parenthesis after the quote.""

If my information is from the website, do I still need to quote the author even if I paraphrased it into my own words and didn't copy off the author's words?
"
817,If I want to primarily explore the unintended consequences of a particular innovation or technology rather than that tech more broadly would that be within the scope of the project?
819,"Would it be ok to write about an innovation that has been researched and developed but is not yet widely in use? For the implications section, I would focus on potential consequences rather than ones that have already been observed. I just wanted to check since the spec says to think of an innovation that has changed the world. Thanks!"
829,Thank you for the pointers!
830,"Hi, 

I edited my block (pic attached below) to utilize for i=1 to 4 but I still am not getting the correct output.  When I input RRRR and RRBG for guess and secret key, I get an output of 1 instead of 1 2.  I'm stuck on how to get the block to return multiple correct numbers instead of just the first one. I tried using join to join i and another value, but I'm not sure which value to join i with. I thought that for i = 1 to 4 automatically iterates through 1 to 4 and stores the values where my condition (letter i of guess = letter i of secret word) is true but I may be mistaken. 

Where did I go wrong?

"
882,Hi! My project doesn't seem to have been graded. Or I can't seem to view it on Gradescope for some reason!
932,Are we allowed to choose one of the example projects for our final project? Like Battleship for example? 
934,Would something like Connect 4 get approved? It's like tic tac toe but more complex than it.
940,"Hi, I tried to submit a .zip-folder but gradescope unpacked it so all the gif-graphics are now in the list of submitted material. Is that alright?"
942,"in the video about the testing for python it said to make another file with the test function and I just duplicated the code for the function in that file, is that alright or do we have to incorporate it into one file because I am currently not able to do that"
960,And we are meeting Thursday around 4 to discuss our project proposal!!!
985,Thank you for responding! But I mean there was only one page and I check marked it so I don’t see how there could be unassigned pages.
989,"Hmm I'm still getting the same error. Is there a difference between the min block I used and this one?
"
1094,"Thanks for the hint! Unfortunately, my problem remains. The thing is, I didn't even write any code in the first place. This problem occurs even if I merely open Python3 and execute that command in the terminal. Everything else seems to be working for the turtle, to goto, the forward, backward, left etc.

So am I supposed to pass in something in the variable pos myself before running ""towards"" ?"
1101,I agree with Yolanda - we would mark down for style given so much repetition. Try to find a pattern to help you abstract the hard-coded numbers. 
1102,"Yeah, both what Yolanda and Samhita said is correct! We want students in this class to ultimately learn good coding and project design habits, so that you can rely on them in the future, regardless of whether you continue to pursue cs. Ultimately, as teachers of a computer science, we'd vastly prefer that you put in the time to slowly figure out the pattern of winning sequences. But if this is a class you're taking without intending to continue in the CS track (or a CS-related track), and you're weighing algorithm-writing time vs final score on the project, you can keep it as-is, so long as you're aware you'll lose some style and feature points for it. "
1112,"On the final project spec, it says that we should submit both a pdf document and a snap or python file. However, when I submitted the pdf of our milestone, it won't let me add the snap file we are working with onto the submission. Is there a way to include our snap file as well?"
1115,"Yeah it doesn't look like gradescope likes the 2 file submission. So, you can put screenshots of your code in your pdf and/or email the code to your TA."
1189,"If we used code that was given to us in a past problem set, would we need to cite that code as well? "
1192,Can we cite codes in the five major characteristics of the project? Will it be considered as lowering the level of complexity? 
1304,Is the project out of 125 or 115 points?
