The second/memory list’s index numbers will include the values in the sorted list, and the values corresponding to these indexes will be the positions from the sorted list. An example: if you have a sorted list [1,4,7,8], your memory list will be 8 items long. At index 4 of the memory list, you will have 2 (i.e. the position of 4 in the sorted list). At index 7 of the memory list, you will have 3, and so on. The number entered in the memory list corresponds to the position in the sorted list. This way, if you’ve found 4 in the sorted list before, you can simply look up item 4 of the memory list and find its position in the sorted list.

An alternative idea would be to use the list of random letters you generated in the previous step, and combining them together similar to how you\u0026#39;re doing it now. It\u0026#39;s important to note that generally you don\u0026#39;t want to be using a HOF within a loop, as HOFs like map, keep, and combine, were really meant to simplify what would otherwise be a rather verbose for loop involving a list operation.

One of the key ideas in this portion is that our game board will store all of the game\u0026#39;s information for what\u0026#39;s at each tile. So another way to think about this is, how do I know I\u0026#39;m on a tile with a bug?

So if you were playing, pressed right, and landed on a bug, then it should change the color of the sprite, and say the dialogue. Part of it is already implemented for you in the block actually, so I\u0026#39;d focus on how you can get the player so say \u0026#34;Oops, I hit a bug!\u0026#34;.

Even though, with two drops, I should have full credit on the probset section. I don\u0026#39;t know where I got point deductions that made my grade below 442 points. I\u0026#39;ve attached the grade calculator that I created. Would you please go over my grade again? \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eThank you very much!\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eRegards,\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eWeiwei Wu\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads\u0026amp;prefix=paste%2Fkaiuz89rkz6op%2F8b5e3b7f92786fe334da43fca50a9eda61140d9c61782aa3197233756ebc99aa%2FCopy_of_CS10_Grade_Calculator.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eCopy_of_CS10_Grade_Calculator.xlsx\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","type":"question","tag_good_arr":["ixvdi0ss3on510"],"created":"2020-08-20T16:51:03.820Z","views":6,"score":1,"editors":["kaiuz89rkz6op"]},{"id":"ke32dh96cbs13","content":"\u003cp\u003eResolved over email.\u003c/p\u003e","type":"i_answer","tag_good_arr":[],"created":"2020-08-20T17:13:41.274Z","parent_id":"ke31kdu4qle257","thread_id":"ke31kdu4qle257","editors":["ixvdi0ss3on510"],"anonimity":["no"]},{"id":"ke3tb355d4n3hh","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe grading calculator being put to good use!!
