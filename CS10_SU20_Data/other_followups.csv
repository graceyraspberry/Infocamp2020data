74,"1. Does the live session from Monday -Wednesday will NEVER be recorded? And if we miss a session, we should watch the video series to make up the content. Is that correct?
2. The Thursday live session is where we will get credit for the SI part and it is 25 pt? And the Friday check-in will worth another 25 pt?
3. Does the attendance for discussion sessions are weekly or daily? How does the attendance affect the grade? Is it ok if I go to discussion one a week or do I need to attend all of the sessions through the week?
4. Which compiler should I use for python? Especially for MAC? 

Sorry for the long list 
Thank you!

657,"Did you mean discussion worksheet 2? If so, they are on the website."
659,"on the class website, there are slides like this for all the other discussions https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QplewxrbWMqLIMvQQGd6IshT3fbGsZgEGahPhEnV30w/edit#slide=id.g8a22355e74_0_192 I was wondering if there were slides like this for discussion 2."
694,better get that 80% 👀👀
696,"Wait if we get 100% do we get all of the ""prizes"" 😌"
839,"I just used normal commands to run my python file. I closed my terminal and restated my computer, but it doesn't work. "
842,"Hi,
Is there a way to keep the window turtle runs in open even after it finishes running the file? The screen my turtle runs in closes immediately after it finishes making it a challenge to see what it did."
844,"one of the AIs, Vaibhav, seems to have found a solution:

""If they created a file called turtle.py then there is a chance that the original turtle is being overriden, so we just deleted that file, and it seemed to work ok""

so if your turtle still doesn't work after reinstalling python, try this!!"

977,"How do we know whether we get full credit for the problem set? I have talked to AI about some minor mistakes in my problem set codes, and wondered whether there are points deducted.Thanks!"

1142,Can you clarify what it means that they will still count toward the P/NP policy and can I use my slip day for these checkoffs?
1184,Do you have to enrolled at Berkeley to become an AI?
1186,I hope it’s not too late to sign up to be an AI (the deadline listed is Aug 19 11:59pm). I just signed up now because I was waiting for my final grade to show up on CalCentral.
1197,"Oh well, I hope it's not true. I'm in this loop chat and Messenger chat where people are talking about it. I mean if it affects students who have not yet declared, then what happens to those who are so close to declaring Data Sci on a margin (say 2.3 GPA on the 2.0 cutoff)?"
1220,"Got it. Thank you! The power is not back yet for the whole neighborhood. I don't know if the power will be back by midnight because it's a Friday evening. 

Also, I will ask Sana to submit our final project as I am not able to do that."

1332,"Thank you everyone for such an awesome semester!! Feel free to reach out to me as well aaronbaker@berkeley.edu (or aaron.jbaker@yahoo.com if they decide to take away my berkeley email). 

Good luck with everything!!!"
