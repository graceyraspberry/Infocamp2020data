166,"Hello, I had the same problem first.

""... but I don’t think that allows my code to keep track of the total # of tries."" - Actually, that is possible! This is how I figured it out: When you start the game, you are at your first try. When you have to try it a second time - in which way does the variable change? And at which point in the script? ... And, of course, which commands does Snap offer to change a variable?

That answer is a little cryptic but I hope it makes it easier for you to get to the solution :D Does this help you?"
168,"Hey, thank you both so much! I’m not sure if I understood what you said correctly but what I did was, I made a [words abstracted away by Maxson for educational purposes hehe]. The problem I have here is that on the times where I got my answer on the first try, the number of tries show up as 2 (because of the +1 factor)."

I also tried taking out the list and placing it in the script workplace (but not in either the set variable block or the keep function), and I kept the variable in the keep function, and it worked as well.

A moment ago I thought I had figured it all out, the algorithm was working fine until I checked the very last number in a list and then something collided. That showed me the code is not working the way it should. I also feel like I did what I learned is called ""hard-coding"" since I am not using HOFs... I did not come up with any idea on how to use them in this case...

486,"Screen_Shot_2020-07-06_at_8.36.40_PM.png

I'm having trouble understanding exactly what we are supposed to do. When it says ""at least TWO boards as input cases,"" does this mean we make two imaginary examples (like in the lecture when Aaron tested 3 different lists for the ""remove duplicates"" block)? And these will return false also, because we haven't filled out the ""merge column () of () up"" yet?

Additionally, I didn't see any test for the rotate clockwise only. Did I miss it somewhere in the checkoff instructions/starting material file?

Thank you!"
489,"To distinguish between merge up and merge column, does merge column mean that if we have 2 and 2 right on top of each other, it will move up and the new values will be 4 and 0 (from top to bottom)? I can't really understand how merge up is different because I feel like it's just the same thing as what I just said but for one column. I looked at the blog and they only differentiate between ""move up"" and ""merge column"". Is merge up the same as move up according to the blog?"

I implemented all my blocks, but it seems to me the pre-build framework is having issues 😳 First, the say commands are not working for me, I saw in the script of „play tic-tac-toe“ that the game is supposed to give me some feedback. But besides the question in the beginning about whether I would like to play as x or o it does not talk to me at all...Second, in the command „draw x-or-o at location cur player“, the variable location says its expecting a list but getting text.

Why does it keep saying getting text instead of list since the variable ""board"" is a list?

518,Is there a function we can use to stop the timer? 
570,"Thank you for your help, Yolanda!

I was also wondering about the Player (green turtle sprite) moving off of the board. We prevented the bug sprite from being placed out of the board through the ""inside block"" condition, but the spec didn't mention anything about doing something similar for the Player. Should we still account for Player?

Also how we would turn in our code? We had to work with two different starter files, so it seems like it'd be a lot of work to copy code from one file to another... How should we combine them? 

"
573,"Another problem came up that I couldn't figure out... 



These two blocks work fine when they're not put together. The first large group of blocks shows the row and column of the space that I clicked on the board, and the gray ""create"" block will create a bug sprite on the space that I clicked. When I put them together, without rerunning the entire block, the game works fine. However, after I join these two blocks and run the entire block (clicking on ""when mouse and inside block""), I get an error saying ""Inside: Error expecting list but getting text"". I don't really understand what's happening here or how I would fix this situation...

Here is my code! If you open it, click the green flag, and start clicking on the board, there is no problem. However, once you click on the large block I described above, the error I described occurs.
