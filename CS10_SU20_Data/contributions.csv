For example, if the red sprite starts on a graph at (-10,5), then a green sprite who will be reflected across the y-axis will start at (10,5). This means that for the green sprite to follow the mouse, it won&#39;t follow the exact coordinates as the red one would, but reflected coordinates (negative and/or shifted).

You are on kind of the right track, but consider that even though we may be ""filtering"" in some sense here, the complexity of the problem may not best fit a HOF. Remember that HOFs can be written as a loop, and sometimes one way may be easier than the other.

Seems like map and keep are not working as smoothly as we'd hope.

<p>I have three questions before I submit my project:</p>
<p>1) (pic 1) My matching slots block kept spitting outputs like 1004 instead of 14 when reporting which characters were correct. The only way I could figure out how to get rid of the zeros was adding else to the if and then saying set (variable) to blank space.  Is this okay? Or is this a faster way to do this? </p>
<p>2) (pic 2) I was able to give player two the option to keep guessing after guessing incorrect through the forever command but even after they guess the code right, after 5 seconds it asks to guess again; how do I get rid of this? I tried using the repeat until answer = correct code in place of forever but that didn&#39;t work. </p>

This is a good start - however, do keep in mind that the (item &lt;num&gt; of &lt;list&gt;) block returns the value and takes in the index as input. Right now, your &lt;num&gt; variable is being used in the 'contains' block correctly, as a value, but is being used in the 'item ? of ?' block as an index. Are the times that the block works the instances where the value of the item matches its place in the block?

I'm having trouble understanding exactly what we are supposed to do. When it says ""at least TWO boards as input cases,"" does this mean we make two imaginary examples (like in the lecture when Aaron tested 3 different lists for the ""remove duplicates"" block)? And these will return false also, because we haven't filled out the ""merge column () of () up"" yet?

Additionally, I didn't see any test for the rotate clockwise only. Did I miss it somewhere in the checkoff instructions/starting material file?

It is *strongly* advised you take a look at problem sets 6 and 7 before starting the project, maybe even complete them!

Once again, please read the spec all the way through. It is completely packed with helpful and necessary information. If you have any questions or need help throughout the project, you can post them as a response to this post so they are easy to find for other students.

<p>This error tells you that some block inside your function is expecting a number as input, but you are trying to pass text in instead. </p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest using visible stepping to see which block is bugging out.

Question 6 is about converting hexadecimal (base 16) and binary numbers into what we are used to working with -- base 10 numbers -- and then performing operations on them. Refer to discussion worksheet 1 from week 1 if you are not sure how to perform this conversion.

In Python, you select specific item(s) from a list with [:::]. Why do you have three sets of colons? Well, the expression can be interpreted like this:

[ index of the first item you want to take(inclusive) : index of the last item you want to take(not inclusive) : slicing(the difference between the index of each item that you take; default == 1) ]

*remember that python uses 0-indexing, so the index of the first item will always be 0.*

a = [2, 12, 53, 90, 20, 17]
a[2] = 12
a[1:3] = [12, 53]
a[::2] = [2, 53, 20]

This post contains information pertaining to the logistics of the final exam. Please read this post all the way through to get all the information.
We will release a three-part, untimed, take-home final exam online using Gradescope on Saturday 8/15 @ 12:01am PDT. The three parts are (a) with Snap!  – a coding challenge, (b) with Python -- a coding challenge in Python, and (c) non-coding – the traditional non-coding exam, but delivered online. A PDF will be provided for the non-coding portion, and you will use Gradescope as an answer sheet.You will have 72 hours to complete it; it will be due by Monday 8/17 @ 11:59pm PDT. You may take as little or as much time as you need within this window. However, we do not anticipate this exam to take 72 hours. Expect to set aside ~6 hours to take this exam: 3 hours for the “in-lab” final (parts a and b), and 3 hours for the non-coding final (part c). 
Note: the coding portion of the final will be significantly longer than the coding portion of the midterm, so please allocate time accordingly.
You are to complete the final exam alone without consulting any other students or online resources except for coding when completing the Snap! &amp; Python portions of the exam, and any handwritten notes you have taken prior to the start of the exam. You may not use Snap! Or Python for the non-coding portion of the exam. We will ask everyone to sign an attestation that they have upheld that policy when they submit their exam.You will be able to ask any clarifying questions by making a private post (Instructors Only) to a Piazza thread we will open up when we release the final. Our staff will respond and answer your questions as quickly as we can, and post the results back to you on Piazza and to a “clarifications” document on the online exam itself (so others will see them and not need to ask the same question).Testable material includes:
All lectures not including guest lectures, social implications sessions, and the alumni panel.All problem sets.

We will make another post once the exam is released announcing its beginning and linking the clarification doc. In the meantime, some things to keep in mind:

The website resources page is a phenomenal study tool

If your score (percentage) on this exam is higher than the midterm, it will replace your midterm score per our “clobber” policy

<p>#pin</p>","Hi everyone!

As the semester comes to an end, maybe you're thinking, gosh I love computer science and a wonderful learning environment. If only I could apply my efforts to make this class even more effective in the future, Well we have a solution for you! You can apply here to take on the role of Academic Intern for CS10 in the Fall. You all have seen how awesome and hard-working our AIs have been (don't forget to thank them), now is your chance to do the same. Oh, and you can get units for it as well!

If you are interested in being an AI, please fill out this application by August 19th at 11:59pm.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me or ZT Num (murtzali_5253@berkeley.edu) through Slack or email.

Hope to see everyone on Zoom this fall :)

<p>I&#39;m sorry for asking questions too frequently(sort of panic about the final lol). I want to clarify that in Q9, the prompt says we cannot use [::-1] or any built-in functions in Python.

<div></div>
<div>This is Weiwei. I think there are some errors in my final grade. I saw an A- on Calcentral, which should be A I think (464.75 points in total). There must be some misunderstandings. I have checked with you and Andrew about the SI sessions attendance (and the reading responses that I made up), which are all set. For the last three prob set, I have gotten an email from the AI, Ben, saying he could not grade them on time since he is moving back to the apartment at Berkeley. Even though, with two drops, I should have full credit on the probset section. I don&#39;t know where I got point deductions that made my grade below 442 points. I&#39;ve attached the grade calculator that I created. Would you please go over my grade again? </div>
